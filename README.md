## About

This repo contains geographic (GIS) data for the Bay Area Rapit Transit (BART) system in the awesome (open) [GeoJSON data format](http://geojson.org/).

Data comes from BART's ["Geospatial Data" page](http://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/geo) and was converted from KML via [CartoDB](www.cartodb.com).
